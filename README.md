# JavaScript Function to Add Two Numbers

This repository contains a JavaScript function designed to add two numbers. However, the initial implementation has issues when dealing with null, undefined, or NaN values.

## Bug Description
The provided function does not correctly handle null, undefined, and NaN values. The function should return 0 if either argument is null, and it should return NaN if either argument is NaN or undefined.

## Bug Solution
The solution improves the function to correctly handle null, undefined, and NaN values, ensuring a more robust addition operation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to view the original buggy code and `bugSolution.js` to view the corrected code.
3. Run the JavaScript files in a browser's console or using Node.js to observe the different outputs.
